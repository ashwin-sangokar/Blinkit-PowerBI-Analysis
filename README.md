# Blinkit Sales Analysis – Power BI

## Project Context
Blinkit operates in the quick-commerce space, where outlet performance, product mix, and customer satisfaction directly impact profitability and operational efficiency.

This project explores Blinkit's sales data to understand how sales, ratings, and inventory distribution vary across outlet types, sizes, and product categories.

## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to:
- Identify sales distribution patterns across outlets
- Compare product category performance
- Understand customer rating trends
- Practice translating business questions into Power BI dashboards

## Key KPIs
- Total Sales
- Average Sales
- Number of Items Sold
- Average Customer Rating

## Key Observations
- Sales performance varies noticeably by outlet size and location tier
- Certain product categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue
- Customer ratings remain relatively stable across most outlet types, suggesting other factors drive sales differences

*(Detailed insights are visualized in the Power BI dashboard.)*

## Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboarding, basic DAX, slicers)
- Excel (Initial data review)

## Limitations
- The dataset was largely clean, requiring minimal preprocessing
- Analysis is primarily descriptive rather than predictive
- No external data (time series, customer demographics, cost data) was available

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved dashboard design and KPI structuring in Power BI
- Better understanding of how to align visuals with business questions
- Realized the importance of deeper analytical reasoning beyond visualization

## Next Improvements
- Work with messier, real-world datasets
- Perform deeper analysis focused on decision-making
- Add business recommendations supported by data
